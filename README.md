opsworks-elasticsearch-cookbook
===============================

This is a fork of the AWS OpsWorks Elasticsearch sample cookbook referenced in [this blog] (http://blogs.aws.amazon.com/application-management/post/Tx3MEVKS0A4G7R5/Deploying-Elasticsearch-with-OpsWorks)

The OpsWorks stack that we use to stand up our elasticsearch cluster depends upon this repository to function.
